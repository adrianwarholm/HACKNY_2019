Mentor - Mentee Traditions

Mentors and mentees will bond more with each other through handing down gifts of their own abstract choice. Mentees will be the mentors’ kids and perhaps can even start a tradition if they’re mentors. The professional goal is to allow mentees to contact alumni their mentors know and enrich the networking experience and streamline it rather than wait for Fellows to be added to the alumni chat.

Hopefully, both can also do events with each other like eating out or games or going to an amusement park or rave. You never know. This experience is more for becoming close friends.



Tradition Passdown
The new class can look at traditions of past classes and choose to implement them into their program. For example, if one of the older classes had a major event such as creating a music video, they can also make one. They should also try to see if they can make a new one themselves. However, I think it’s best to really push for at least one social class project.


Cultural Potluck
Buy or cook food you culturally identify with or have a strong personal bond to. Share it with everyone. Preferably after everyone has gotten their first paychecks. This can also hold another event such as a movie night or a night where we share baby photos and guess who it is.


Most Likely To
Attribute who’s most likely to do actions. Will be revealed sometime during the week. There’s a list of Most Likely Tos… For example, Most Likely To Eat Rice - Mohammed.



Pass the Tea [NM]
Each Fellow tells a story they want to share about themselves. Should tell us about their character.



Appreciation Circle [NM]
One of the mentors, or how many the Fellows wants, help read an appreciation question and set groups. A group goes to the middle as everyone else faces away and taps people they appreciate it for the question.

Custom Escape the Room
This may take a while for us to make ourselves...But it’ll be the mentors and a fellow who makes it for the other fellows. Just an idea. It’s customized to the Fellow Class.


DO NOT LAUGH
Summer challenge when Fellows hold water in their mouths. If they laugh, they spill water out their mouths of course. Fellows sit across from each other and try not to laugh and spill water.


Summer Marathon
Get ready and geared up. Fellows need to struggle together and do a Marathon together. We win and struggle. However, we can never be too far spaced out. Stay together!


Game Night
Super Smash Bros is perfect but more games the better.


Fundraising Event
A sale to help HackNY and future fellows despite donations.
